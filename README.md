# School Musical Website
I got the opportunity to make a Website for a school play. This project is being done in my free time, free of charge! Never the less I want to use this as a learning school into the world of web development. It is a work in progress and it will still be updated regularly. üëå

Here you can see multiple things (UPDATED):

-  The navigation bar redirects you immediately to where you want to go on the website
-  There are multiple buttons to go to the tickets since this is where we want the user to go towards
-  Added a small working countdown timer to make the event feel more alive (UPDATED)
-  School logo has been made cleaner (UPDATED)
-  Background picture has been changed to fit the theme more (UPDATED)
-  Added a dark mode (UPDATED)

### All pictures and the full website are probably going to change heavily next weeks

This part is pretty straight forward. It just gives a small bit of information about the musical.

### NOTE: THE INFORMATION IS RANDOMLY GENERATED JUST FOR NOW BECAUSE THE REAL PLAY IS NOT MADE YET!

</p>

Multiple points:

- You will be able to look at all roles given to the whole class. Since the play is not made yet, all pictures used are AI generated and safe to use.
- After you went through the musical itself you get to the buying your tickets part. There will only be one option for the tickets since it is a small play in a school.
- After you selected your tickets you will be redirected to a different page. WILL BE ADDED SOON!

### The buy your tickets spot will most likely be moved.

I think it would be fun for the parents and family members to read previous experiences from other parents on how their experience was. This might be changed if the school desides this does not add much.

### These images and names are also generated and not real!

Notes:

-  Since not everyone is from the area itself, I added a map so people can easily learn where it is located and where they can park
-  For extra I gave the option to specifically ask a question about the musical that gets send to the right person.
-  For protection I erased confident information from the images.
-  At last if they want to keep updated, I added the option to submit your email so the school knows who wants to be updated but this will probably be removed since the school has their own way of communicating already üòä (REMOVED IN UPDATE)
-  Changed colour to fit the logos colour theme more (UPDATED)

### All files are being updated regularly when new things are learned. I already learned a lot from this first real web project üòÅ
